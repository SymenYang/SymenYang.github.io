Ph.D. Student  
School of Computer Science  
Fudan University, Shanghai, China

### About me
I am a Ph.D. Student in the school of Computer Science at Fudan University. I am advised by [Prof. Cheng Jin](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/jc/zh_CN/index.htm). I received my B.S. (with honors) in Computer Science from Fudan University. My researches focus on 3D objects/scenes generation and understanding. I strongly believe that the deepest understanding of 3D scenes is to learn to generate them. My current publications lie on 3D objects/scene generation, and I am also staying tuned in the field of understanding.    
Besides my interests in researching, I also like to record the world with my eyes and my cameras. Selected photos I take are shared in the Gallery.
